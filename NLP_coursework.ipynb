              "1986   I find it ironic to believe that in a well developed country like the U.K child benefits is offered to every child plus free education , school trips . Ghana on the other hand , an under developed country has no child benefits system for its children , or housing benefit and I write some children to date are being educated under the trees in this 21st century Ghana . For example , the child benefit was introduced in Britain in 1798 and later stopped but reintroduced in 1909 . How could our system help poor families to help with Ghana economy ? What is stopping Ghana in addressing poverty within families and emulating this forward thinking attributes of British in eradicate child poverty .
